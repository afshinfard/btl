1) script that will re-get ALL publications (requires getting html file)
2) script that takes pubsource, some year, and rearrages all the tabs etc. to match
3) script that only updates the current year publications

SOURCE FILE: 

publicationsource:
    - can be updated with scrape.py but requires getting the full HTML
    - used for re-arranging tabs 
    - needs to somehow be updated with current year stuff
    
change tabs (take in a year):
    - changes tabs to starting with the given year
    - uses publication source 
    
update current year:
    - get everything from current year, delete everything in publicationsource with that class and replace it with whatever you get
    - publications.html will still source from this
