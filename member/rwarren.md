### About

René is a researcher with extensive experience in computational biology, a prolific scientific research author
and regular reviewer for peer reviewed genomics and bioinformatics journals. In his career, he has been at the
forefront of innovation, and pioneered a number of bioinformatics “firsts”. Among those, SSAKE, the first
algorithm for de novo genome assembly with short DNA sequences [1]. Algorithms of SSAKE are the core of
many genomics applications and their design continues to inspire new-generation technologies. Applications of
the software extend beyond genome assembly; The innovative technology was applied to profiling T-cell
metagenomes [12], targeted de novo genome sequence assembly (TASR) [5], HLA typing (HLAminer [16] and
NMDP Be The Match®), genome scaffolding with long reads (LINKS) [3], proteome assembly (PASS) and was
key to the discovery of Fusobacterium in colon cancer [9], a finding designated as one of the top 10 medical
breakthroughs of 2011 by Time magazine.
