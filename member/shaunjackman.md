### About Me
I live in Vancouver, Canada, where I'm a PhD candidate studying bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia with my supervisor, Inanc Birol. I analyze genome sequencing data from a variety of species, including spruce trees and human. I develop software that takes fragmented genome sequencing data and attempts to reassemble the original genome from which the short fragments were derived. My undergraduate degree is in computer engineering. I'm a programmer, an avid traveller, a singer, and an experimental cook.
