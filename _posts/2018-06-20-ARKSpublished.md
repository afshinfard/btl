Our latest genome assembly scaffolder, ARKS, was just published in the peer-reviewed journal [BMC bioinformatics](https://rdcu.be/1h3M)
The paper describes a new read alignment-free methodology that employs kmer-based read mapping and improves assembly runtime.
In the paper we present benchmarks on human genome draft assemblies and show how linked reads can improve drafts assembled with the same sequencing data further.
