title: "ABySS 2.0, Tigmint, ARKS, and Bloom Filters at RECOMB-Seq"  
category: conference  
---  

[RECOMB 2018](http://recomb2018.fr/) will be taking place in Paris, France, from April 21-24th. [RECOMB-Seq](http://recomb2018.fr/recomb-seq/) is one of its four satellite workshops this year, taking place from April 19-20th, bringing together researchers in computational genomics and bioinformatics to discuss new frontiers in gene sequencing.

##### BTL has four posters at RECOMB-Seq this year:
RECOMB ID #1, SEQ-6, **ARKS**: chromosome-scale human genome scaffolding with linked read kmers  
RECOMB ID #10, SEQ-8, **Multi-Index Bloom Filters**: A probabilistic data structure for sensitive multi-reference sequence   classification with multiple spaced seeds  
RECOMB ID #21, SEQ-7, **Tigmint**: Correct Assembly Errors Using Linked Reads From Large Molecules. See [poster](https://f1000research.com/posters/7-481).  
SEQ-10, **ONTig**: Contiguating Genome Assembly using Oxford Nanopore Long Reads

##### Talks: ABySS 2.0 and Tigmint
Shaun Jackman will be presenting a highlight talk on ABySS 2.0 [(slides)](http://sjackman.ca/abyss2-slides/), as well as a talk on Tigmint [(slides)](http://sjackman.ca/tigmint-recomb-slides/).  
The ABySS 2.0 paper and abstract is available at [Genome Research](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/5/768)  
The Tigmint paper is available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/20/304253)  
The ARKS paper is available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/25/306902)
